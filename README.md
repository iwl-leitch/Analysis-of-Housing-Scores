# Analysis of Housing Scores

The goal of Analysis of Housing Scores is to explore whether or not housing scores have improved since the implementation of RentSafe Toronto. It uses one dataset: data. This dataset is publicly available on Open Data Toronto [@citeOpenDataToronto], and is called Apartment Building Evaluation. 

The paper considers apartment scores, the year the scores were given out and the type of housing that the apartment falls under.It tracks these scores from 2017 through 2021.  It compares the mean, min and max scores of apartments by type, and finds that improvements have been made to a point, but that the data is unreliable in many ways due to bias.
